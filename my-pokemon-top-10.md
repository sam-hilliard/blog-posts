# My Top 10 Favorite Pokemon!

Hello again! In this post, I'm going to take a little detour from
the more serious tutorial posts and share my top 10
favorite pokemon with you! I'm not much of a stats guru
so my selection is going to be based mostly on looks. This
is also going to exclude starter Pokemon (I'll probably do
a seperate post on this) and Legendaries/Mythicals/Ultrabeasts.
So, let's get right into it!

## 10. Joltik

I'm not a bug person by any means and I hate spiders. Joltik
is definitely an exception. It's so tiny and cute I love it!
Plus, it has a super sick evolution, Garvantula. It's typing
of bug/electric is pretty cool too! This is one spider I 
definitel wouldn't squish.

## 9. Salandit

I love fire types and salandit definitely stands out among them 
for me. It's blacked out, slithery/thin design is so cool and
I love that flames eminate from the stripe on it's tail. Females
evolve into Salazzle, which is pretty cool (and rare in-game),
but I'm slightly more of a fan of it's base. Not to say that
Salazzle is a terrible evolution, but given how rare it is,
it definitely could have been cooler.

## 8. Sandile

Crocodile's are badass as is and Sandile takes that to a whole
'nother level. It's got an egyptian vibe to it, plus, it's
dark/ground typing is swaggy too like T-tar. It's base evolution
is so cute. I feel like I could walk it and play fetch with it
like a doggo. It's other two evolutions are so badass, but if
I were to have this mon in real life, I'd probably just stick
with the base because I love it so much.

## 7. Electrike

Electrike is one of my go to electric-type mons in Emerald. I 
just love the design so much and, to be fair, I'm a bit biased
towards dog-like mons. All that aside, electrike looks sick and
I can totally see it being super fast and extremely loyal. It
also has a great evevolution and mega-evolution. I want to have
an electrike in real life so bad haha.

## 6. Galarian Farfetch'd
