# Welcome to my Blog!

This being the first post, I just wanted to write a quick introduction of what
different topics I'm going to write about and some reasons why I wanted to start
writing my own blog. So, without further-ado, lets get into it!

## Why start a blog?

Initially, I wanted to start a blog because I thought it would be a fun project to work on. I had just finshed working on my
portfolio site and wanted to expand upon it, so I thought "why
not?" I also thought it would be pretty cool to have my own blog.
I'm not expecting many people to read it, but posting your
thoughts to an audience as wide as the internet is a pretty 
powerful thing.

I also want to use this blog to build on my knowledge. One of the
best ways to learn something confidently is to teach, so I'll be
posting tutorials here as well.

## Main topics

As stated earlier, the main focus of this blog will be tutorials
that I will help me solidify my learning [Daniel Messlier's Blog](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/)
is an excellent example of what I hope to one day acheive.

Outside of this, I'd like to write about my experiences in my 
career and life in general. This could be in the form of career advice,
life updates, or anything else I feel like writing about.

This is my space where I have the freedom to post whatever I want and I
can't wait to share more with you!

So, welcome to my blog and thank you for starting this journey with me :).
